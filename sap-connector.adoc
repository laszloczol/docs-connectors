SAP Connector v5.0

The Anypoint Connector for SAP enables the integration of data to and from external systems based on SAP NetWeaver.

The SAP Connector is not available in the Design Center feature of Anypoint Platform.

This connector requires a separate license. Contact MuleSoft to evaluate or use this connector in production.

Mule runtime supports SAP integration through the Anypoint Connector for SAP, an SAP-certified Java connector that leverages the SAP Java Connector (JCo) libraries, thus allowing Mule applications to:

* Execute BAPI functions over the RFC protocol, supporting the following types:
** Synchronous Remote Function Call RFC (sRFC)
** Asynchronous Remote Function Call RFC (aRFC)
* Act as a JCo Server to be called as a BAPI over sRFC, aRFC
* Send IDocs over tRFC and qRFC.
* Receive IDocs over tRFC and qRFC.
* Transform SAP objects (JCo function for BAPI and IDocs) to and from XML.

See <<SAP Terminology>> to understand SAP acronyms.

== About Connectors

Anypoint Connectors are Mule runtime engine extensions that enable you to connect to APIs 
and resources on external systems, such as Salesforce, SAP, ServiceNow, and Twitter.

== Prerequisites

This document assumes you have:

* A working knowledge of the SAP business context and in particular, the SAP R/3 Business Suite.
* A basic understanding of the SAP NetWeaver Platform from an administration point of view.
* Knowledge of the ABAP language.
* Login credentials to test your connection to your target resource.
* The SAP connector uses the RFC protocol to connect to NetWeaver Application Servers (NWAS). http://www.cipherbsc.com/solutions/sap-erp-central-component-erp-ecc/[ECC] and https://help.sap.com/viewer/p/SAP_CUSTOMER_RELATIONSHIP_MANAGEMENT[CRM] run on top of NWAS, as other SAP solutions do, and hence any customer using the connector may access those systems.

Before creating an app:

. You must have access to the SAP target resource, Anypoint Platform, and understand how to create a Mule app using Anypoint Studio.
. Browse to the SAP web site and download the version 3.0.18 libraries
for IDOC, JCO, and JCO Native. The library formats are usable by
Studio 7 directly without conversion. You can download them to
a folder on your computer. You must have a SAP ID to download the libraries.

== Audience

* Starting user -- Configure your Mule application in 
xref:sap/sap-connector-studio.adoc[Anypoint Studio]. The xref:sap/sap-connector-config-topics.adoc[Additional Configuration Information] topic helps you extend your understanding of the SAP Connector.
* Power user - Read xref:sap/sap-connector-xml-maven.adoc[XML and Maven Support], 
the xref:sap/sap-connector-config-topics.adoc[Additional Configuration Information] topic, 
and xref:sap/sap-connector-examples.adoc[Examples].

== SAP Terminology

ABAP (advanced business application programming)::
SAP proprietary programming language and part of the NetWeaver platform for building business applications.

ALE (application link enabling)::
Sets up distributed applications and integrated installation of SAP systems. This involves business-driven message exchange using consistent data across loosely linked SAP apps. Apps are integrated through synchronous and asynchronous communication, rather than by use of a central database.

BAPI (business application programming interface)::
The function module that fulfills design criteria, such as:
** Implement a method of a SAP business object.
** Maintain a static interface through different versions of the SAP system.
** Enable remotely.
** Run to completion with or without user interaction.
** Handle errors.

FM (function module)::
Procedures defined in the ABAP language of SAP that allow the encapsulation and reuse of global functions in SAP.

IDoc (Intermediate Document)::
Standard SAP format for electronic data interchange between SAP systems. Different message types (such as delivery notes or purchase orders) generally correspond to different special formats, known as IDoc types. Multiple message types with related content can, however, be assigned to a single IDoc type.

Java API::
Handles dynamic metadata lookup and caching. The Java API implements the `JCO.Function` container used for parameters and/or tables for the SAP BAPI function module in Java. Java apps are built on top of the Java API.

JNI (Java native interface)::
Originally, SAP created libraries in C language to allow direct RFC calls to SAP, to manipulate with data. JCo wraps C libraries in Java to provide platform-native access into the SAP system. RFC middleware uses RFC library through the JNI Layer.

RFC (remote function call)::
Communication with the SAP system is performed over the RFC protocol. RFC means calling BAPI or triggering IDoc processing that runs in another system as calling program. The RFC interface enables function calls between two SAP systems or between the SAP and external system.

RFC Layer::
SAP component that processes remote function calls.

RFC Library::
Libraries of C language-based functions to access the SAP system. The RFC library is addressed by JNI.

SAP Java IDoc class library::
Provides structured, high-level interpretation and navigation of SAP IDocs in Java that consists of the following add-on packages:
** SAP Java base IDoc class library: a middleware-independent library that provides a set of general base classes and interfaces for middleware dependent Java IDoc class library implementations.
** SAP Java connector IDoc class library: A middleware-independent library for creating, sending, and receiving IDocs.

SAP NetWeaver::
One of the main technologies and application platforms used by SAP solutions. The main component of NetWeaver is the SAP Web Application Server (WebAS), which provides the runtime environment for SAP applications like ERP, CRM, SCM, PLM, SRM, and BI. Other components include the enterprise portal, exchange infrastructure, master data management, and mobile infrastructure. The SAP NetWeaver is an umbrella term for these technical components. SAP NetWeaver runs on both the Java and ABAP stacks.

SNC (Secure Network Communications):: 
SNC integrates with the SAP NetWeaver single sign-on, or an external security product that works with SAP systems. SNC provides security functions that are not directly available with SAP systems.
+
NOTE: SNC is not supported for use in apps that deploy the SAP Connector in Runtime Manager (CloudHub).

== Exchange Templates and Examples

https://www.mulesoft.com/exchange/[Anypoint Exchange] provides templates and examples 
to simplify your use of the SAP connector. Templates provide a starting point 
that enables you to add additional functionality. Examples provide a complete solution.
